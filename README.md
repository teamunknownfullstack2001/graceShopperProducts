# Welcome to Unknown Grace Shopper

----READ ME----

In our overly commified present day, what is left to sell?

We’ve polluted our relationships with smartphones, social media, and dating apps. We live atomized lives in crowded cities where we don’t even know our neighbors.

Can we go back? How do we learn to form meaningful relationships again?

Unfortunately, this website cannot remedy these problems. In the meantime, we’ve found a quick hack. Forget awkward small talk at the bar, don’t worry about joining that sports league... Friendship is just a click away at friendShop.

Get started now by renting friends directly from our expertly curated collection - you’ve got a friend in friendShop.
